textfriend
==========


textfriend is a first stab at creating a TextMate syntax highlight engine.

It's not perfect (yet) as it doesn't color quite the same as SublimeText.  It's
also not been optimised in ANY way - so it's not that brisk yet either.  On 
the plus side as TextMate grammars pull out higher level entities e.g. function
definitions/calls we can use it to implement a resonable C & C++ version of 
ctags.

Not sure why it's not quite acurate yet - any ideas would be welcome.


Requirements

The new Python regex module, called `regex`


Keywords
